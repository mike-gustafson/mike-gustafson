### Hello World! I'm Mike.

I'm a software engineer in the Seattle area with a passion for making life simpler with technology.

I believe the most impactful thing an engineer can do is had the tech fade into the background while the user gets a full featured experience.  Whether that's through allowing them to perform complex actions with the click of a mouse or a wave of the hand.

As developers we have great power and a great responsibility to grant the every-day user the superpowers of a god-tier tech guru without a barrier to entry.
